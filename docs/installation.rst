Installing ShellP
=================


Requirements and Compatibility
------------------------------
ShellP is supposed to work on any platform, but it has only been tested on Linux.
If you are using a different platform and ShellP isn't working on it, report it
by opening an issue on ShellP's GitHub repository.

ShellP is compatible with Python 3.6 and newer.


Installation
------------
To install ShellP, use this command (without ``sudo``)::

   pip3 install --user shellp
